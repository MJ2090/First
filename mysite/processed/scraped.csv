0,ss,"ss. Smile is a 2022 American supernatural horror thriller[3] film written and directed by Parker Finn (in his feature directorial debut), based on his 2020 short film Laura Hasn't Slept. The film stars Sosie Bacon as a therapist named Rose Cotter, who, after witnessing the bizarre suicide of a patient, goes through increasingly disturbing and daunting experiences, leading her to believe what she is experiencing is supernatural. It also stars Jessie T. Usher, Kyle Gallner, Kal Penn, and Rob Morgan, as well as Caitlin Stasey playing the same character she played in the short film.  A feature adaptation of Finn's short was announced in June 2020, and the cast was added in October 2021. Principal photography began that month in New Jersey and ended in November. Originally set for release on the streaming service Paramount+, distributor Paramount Pictures opted to release the film theatrically after positive test screenings.  Smile premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2022, and was released in the United States on September 30. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the visuals, themes, cinematography, and Bacon's performance, but criticized some of its jump scares and noted similarities to other horror films The Ring and It Follows. It was a box office success, grossing $216.1 million worldwide against a $17 million budget.  Plot At a psychiatric ward, therapist Dr. Rose Cotter meets with Laura Weaver, a graduate student who witnessed her art history professor die by suicide a few days earlier. Laura claims that an entity taking the form of smiling people has been terrorizing her and has told her that she is going to die. Soon thereafter, Laura stumbles to the floor and begins screaming. After Rose calls for help, she sees Laura standing up and smiling. With a shard of a broken vase, Laura kills herself by slitting her throat. Rose later sees her manic patient Carl smiling and shouting that she is going to die. Rose calls for nurses to restrain him, only to see he was asleep the whole time. Concerned for Rose's mental well-being, her supervisor Dr. Morgan Desai gives her a week off.  In the following days, the hallucinations continue, making Rose seem unhinged and dangerous to people around her. She visits her former therapist, Dr. Madeline Northcott, who suggests that her problems stem from her abusive and mentally ill mother, whose death from an overdose she witnessed as a child. At her nephew's birthday party, Rose's gift had been replaced by her dead cat, horrifying the children. She sees a party guest smiling at her and falls onto a glass table, ending the party in chaos. She begins to suspect she has fallen victim to a curse.  Upon learning that Laura's professor was grinning at her before his death, Rose visits his widow, Victoria, and learns that he had witnessed a suicide shortly before his own. Rose asks her ex-boyfriend Joel, a police detective, to go through police records. They find several cases where someone witnessed a suicide, then a few days later died by suicide in front of someone else, who continued the pattern.  Rose's hallucinations intensify. Joel discovers that nearly all the witnesses died within a week of seeing the previous suicide. The exception was Robert Talley, who instead murdered someone else. Rose and Joel visit him in jail, where he claims that the entity feeds on trauma, and the only way to escape it is to kill someone in front of a witness to traumatise them, passing the entity to them. Rose angrily rejects the option and leaves.  She is confronted at home by the entity in Madeline's form, where it gleefully warns her that she is running out of time. She impulsively drives to her hospital with a knife, planning to murder Carl in front of someone to pass the entity to them. But she decides she can't go through with it. Morgan notices her with the knife, but she speeds away, prompting him to alert the police.  Rose drives to her abandoned family home, realizing that she cannot pass on the entity if she remains alone. Rose confronts the entity in the form of her mother, and it's revealed that as a child, Rose found her mother as she was dying from a drug overdose, but decided not to get help. The entity attacks Rose, who has a hallucination.  Soon Joel pulls up, having tracked Rose's phone. The entity rips off its own skin to reveal its true form â€“ a skinless humanoid creature with multiple sets of malformed jaws nested within an enormous, smiling mouth. It forces itself inside her body through her mouth. Joel breaks down the front door only to see Rose set herself on fire with a smile, passing the curse onto him."
